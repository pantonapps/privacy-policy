    <section>
      <h2>Data Transfer Mechanisms</h2>
      <p>By using our services, you agree that your personal data may be transferred to or stored on servers located in the United States. As many third-party service providers operate outside the United Kingdom, processing your personal data may involve data transfers outside the U.S.</p>
      <p>We strictly transfer data only to countries that offer an adequate level of protection, and in certain cases, we use approved contractual mechanisms to secure your data.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data Collection</h2>
      <p>The data accessible to us is primarily defined by Shopify. Upon installation, our app automatically retrieves specific data categories from your Shopify account via the Shop API (e.g., shop email, domain, country). For more details, please refer to the <a href="https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-rest/2023-04/resources/shop" target="_blank">Shopify API documentation</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data Usage</h2>
      <p>All apps access shop information for billing purposes and for providing services that require Shopify API access.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Cookies</h2>
      <p>Our apps use only essential functional cookies to ensure proper operation. We do not utilize any marketing or advertising cookies.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Security Policy</h2>
      <p>Your personal data security is a priority for us. We implement industry-standard security measures, continuously enhance our protocols, and restrict access to authorized personnel. However, we cannot guarantee absolute security of data transmitted over the Internet or stored electronically.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data Retention</h2>
      <p>We retain your personal data only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, including compliance with legal and regulatory obligations. When an app is uninstalled, all personal data is deleted within 60 days.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data Loss Prevention</h2>
      <p>We routinely perform risk assessments and implement measures such as authentication, authorization, and encryption to protect your sensitive data, as well as monitor for any unauthorized access.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Your Legal Rights</h2>
      <p>You have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal data. Contact us at <a href="mailto:support@pantonapps.com">support@pantonapps.com</a> to exercise these rights. We will respond within one month, or up to three months in complex cases.</p>
      <p><strong>Rights for European Residents:</strong> European residents may request access, correction, deletion, or restrictions regarding the processing of their data, and may withdraw consent if the processing is based on it.</p>
      <p><strong>Rights for California Residents:</strong> In accordance with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), we will respond to verifiable requests within 45 days or, if needed, up to 90 days with written notification. California residents may also opt out of any data sale, though we do not sell personal data.</p>
      <p><strong>Additional Rights:</strong> You may request a summary of data collected over the past 12 months or request its deletion without facing discrimination for doing so.</p>
      <p><strong>Mandatory Verification:</strong> As required by CCPA, we will verify your identity before processing your request. If verification fails, we may be unable to fulfill your request.</p>
